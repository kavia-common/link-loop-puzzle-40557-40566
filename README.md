# link-loop-puzzle-40557-40566

This workspace contains the Link Loop frontend (React) implementing the puzzle game with a modern Ocean Professional theme, responsive grid, SVG path animation, undo/reset, timer, and optional leaderboard.

Note: Each play generates a randomized, seeded Hamiltonian path with shuffled neighbor order and bias toggles to avoid horizontal-only layouts. Valid solutions can be vertical, horizontal, or mixed with turns.
