# link-loop-puzzle-40557-40566

This workspace contains the Link Loop frontend (React) implementing the puzzle game with a modern Ocean Professional theme, responsive grid, SVG path animation, undo/reset, timer, and optional leaderboard.

Note: Each play generates a randomized Hamiltonian path across the grid (not fixed horizontal), so valid solutions can be vertical or mixed.
